This project focuses on analyzing customer churn patterns to identify customers at risk of leaving a business. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning techniques, the project aims to uncover key factors driving churn and help businesses take proactive actions to improve customer retention.

The workflow includes:

Cleaning and preprocessing customer datasets

Performing in-depth exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns

Building and evaluating machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

Predicting customer churn probability

This project showcases both the analytical and predictive power of data science in solving real-world business problems.
